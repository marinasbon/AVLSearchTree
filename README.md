# AVLSearchTree
AVL Search Tree Implementation in Java

This repository contains an implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) self-balancing binary search tree in Java. AVL trees are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.
